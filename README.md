--Tube strainer cap for processing histological tissue
--allows filling (open setting), straining (strainer setting), 
  and stirring (close setting) without changing cap or tube.
--Cap fits on Fischer Scientific 2mL MCT Graduated Tubes, 05-408-146
--Glue small square of nylon mesh over rectangular frame, and then fit into sliding cap
--Nylon stockings work, but stretch firmly before gluing
--Print quality should be quite high in order for slider to work smoothly 
--Printed with support from the build surface
--Remove support material carefully with scalpel or dental pick
  to ensure good fit over tube
--Test prints were with ABS on a Lulzbot Taz4 with hexagon print head
  upgrade (which is essentially a Taz5) at fine resolution (0.16 layer height)
--measurements are in mm (standard for openSCAD)
