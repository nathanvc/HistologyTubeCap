OpenSCAD design & STL file

--Tube strainer cap for processing histological tissue

--allows filling (open setting), straining (strainer setting) and stirring (close setting) without changing cap or tube

--Cap fits on Fischer Scientific 2mL MCT Graduated Tubes, 05-408-146

--Glue small square of nylon mesh over rectangular frame, and then fit into sliding cap

--Nylon stockings work, but stretch firmly before gluing

--Print quality should be quite high in order for slider to work smoothly 

--Printed with support from the build surface

--Remove support material carefully with scalpel or dental pick to ensure good fit over tube

--Test prints were with ABS on a Lulzbot Taz4 with hexagon print head upgrade (which is essentially a Taz5) at fine resolution (0.16 layer height)

--measurements are in mm (standard for openSCAD)
